		<msg id="scroll_text1-0-4" cont="All of us got confused about the mess\in the dungeons because the little king\had created it by himself not typical of a mere child.\Then Veradrix told us about how it was possible\through the 'special core pieces'.\ \The special core pieces are required\for the child with the king's destiny\to weild the power of the king.\Originally, it was one complete core\but when the Lord of Destruction was sealed\by the Grand Sage, the core was torn into pieces\and scattered all over the world.\Each core piece contains enormous power,\and if all of them were gathered by their true owner,\they could be used in either\bringing great destruction or\achieving a peaceful world.\ \" />
